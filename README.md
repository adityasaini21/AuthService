Expense Tracker API - JWT Authentication üîê
A robust and secure backend authentication system for the Expense Tracker application, built using Java and Spring Boot. This project implements a modern authentication mechanism using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) with both Access Tokens and Refresh Tokens for enhanced security and user experience.

‚ú® Features
Secure User Registration: Endpoint for new users to sign up with hashed password storage (using BCrypt).

User Login: Authenticates users and returns a pair of JWTs.

Access Token: A short-lived token used to access protected resources.

Refresh Token: A long-lived token used to generate a new access token without requiring the user to log in again.

Token Refresh Endpoint: A dedicated endpoint (/api/auth/refresh) to get a new access token.

Protected Routes: Middleware to verify JWTs on incoming requests to secure application endpoints.

Centralized Exception Handling: Gracefully handles authentication and authorization errors.

‚öôÔ∏è How It Works: The Authentication Flow
This system uses a token-based authentication flow which is ideal for stateless RESTful APIs.

Register & Login:

A new user registers via the /api/auth/register endpoint. Their password is securely hashed and stored.

The user logs in with their credentials at /api/auth/login.

Token Issuance:

Upon successful login, the server generates two tokens:

A short-lived Access Token (e.g., expires in 15 minutes).

A long-lived Refresh Token (e.g., expires in 7 days).

Both tokens are sent back to the client.

Accessing Protected Data:

To access a protected route (e.g., /api/expenses), the client sends the Access Token in the Authorization header of the request (Bearer <token>).

The server validates the token's signature and expiration. If valid, it grants access.

Refreshing the Session:

When the Access Token expires, the client will receive a 401 Unauthorized or 403 Forbidden error.

The client then calls the /api/auth/refresh endpoint, sending its Refresh Token.

The server validates the refresh token. If it's valid, it issues a brand new Access Token, allowing the user to continue their session seamlessly.
